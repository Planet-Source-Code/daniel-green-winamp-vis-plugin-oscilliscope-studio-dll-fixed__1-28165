Oscilliscope Studio ReadME
======================
This program and its source is copyright 2001 morphedmedia.com, under the zlib/ping license.  All other source is copyright various authors and full credit to them is given throughout the source.

Instructions:

use oscstudio.vbp to create your own winamp vis plugin.  when you compile it, name it "vis_title.exe" and place it in the winamp\plugins folder.  place the vis_oscstudio.dll in that folder also, and change the filename to match your .exe, but while retaining the .dll.  not too complicated.

Notes:

this version is in no way complete; i have been busy with other projects.  rest assured i will be completing it in (hopefully) direct3d.
